## 1. Overview

A community-driven, bilingual (Bengali/English) doctor discovery platform for Bangladesh. The core job-to-be-done: a person needs to reach a doctor — the app surfaces the phone number and chamber details so they can call and arrange an appointment themselves.

---

## 2. Goals

- Build a searchable, open database of doctors in Bangladesh organized by specialty
- Allow anyone to contribute doctor information; submissions go live only after admin approval
- Surface actionable contact info (phone, chamber address, visiting hours) quickly
- Start with Dhaka; schema and structure supports all of Bangladesh from day one

**Non-goals (v1):**
- In-app appointment booking
- Payment processing
- Telemedicine

- All submissions enter a **pending queue** — nothing goes live until an admin approves
- Full edit history stored (who submitted what change, when)
- Any user can flag a profile as having incorrect information

### 4.5 Doctor Self-Submission & Verification

- A doctor registers an account and either claims an existing profile or creates a new one
- To get a **Verified Doctor** badge, they upload supporting documents (medical certificate, BMDC card, visiting card, etc.)

---

## 6. Geographic Rollout

- Data model supports all 64 districts of Bangladesh from day one
- Initial data seeding and outreach focused on **Dhaka**
- Other divisions / districts unlock as data is contributed

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Uptime:** 99.5% availability
- **Search response:** < 1 second for typical queries
- **Mobile-friendly:** web app must work well on low-end Android browsers (primary Bangladesh use case)
- **Low-bandwidth tolerance:** pages should be lightweight; avoid heavy assets

---

## 8. Open Questions for Later Phases

- Should contributors earn reputation/trust scores over time (reducing need for admin approval per edit)?
- Do we want a doctor-facing dashboard showing how many people viewed their profile?
- Will we eventually integrate with BMDC's registry for automated verification?
